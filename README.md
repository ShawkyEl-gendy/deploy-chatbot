# deploy-chatbot
- I create an environment for this project, you can do that if you want "py -3.10 -m venv your_env", but first download the file "python-3.10.0-amd64.exe"
- activate ".\your_env\Scripts\Activate "
- If there is an error, it is because PowerShell sometimes blocks script execution.
To allow it temporarily: "Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass" then activate the env
- install the requirements files
- to run: "streamlit run main.py"
- feel free to use the app :) https://shawkyel-gendy-deploy-chatbot-main-ixaox0.streamlit.app/
- Note there are some bugs in the app :(
