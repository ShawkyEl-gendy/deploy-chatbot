# deploy-chatbot
- I create environment for this project, you can do that if you want "py -3.10 -m venv your_env", but first downloaded file "python-3.10.0-amd64.exe"
- activate ".\your_env\Scripts\Activate "
- if do error, it because PowerShell sometimes blocks script execution.
To allow it temporarily:"Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass" then activate the env
- install the requirements files
- to run:"streamlit run main.py"
